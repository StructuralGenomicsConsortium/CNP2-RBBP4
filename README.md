# CNP2-RBBP4
An SGC Chemical Networks Project Devoted to the target RBBP4

The ask: you contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple Rules, you can get started.

The molecule at the heart of this project is this:

CN(C)C(CC1)CN1C2=NC(NCCCN(C)C)=NC3=CC(OC)=C(OC)C=C32


For data on this compound, and why it's an important target for synthetic variation, go to the wiki.

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the FAQs.

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions.

Current scientific status of the project is on the wiki (you can always find the relevant tab above). The current version of the research paper describing this project is at  https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.01.05.475077v1 and is a great place to start if you're new to all this.
